public static byte[] readAllBytesâ€‹(Path path) throws IOException
Reads all the bytes from a file. The method ensures that the file is closed when all bytes have been read or an I/O error, or other runtime exception, is thrown.
Note that this method is intended for simple cases where it is convenient to read all bytes into a byte array. It is not intended for reading in large files.
Parameters:
path - the path to the file
Returns:
a byte array containing the bytes read from the file
Throws:
IOException - if an I/O error occurs reading from the stream
OutOfMemoryError - if an array of the required size cannot be allocated, for example the file is larger that 2GB
SecurityException - In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is installed, the checkRead method is invoked to check read access to the file.
